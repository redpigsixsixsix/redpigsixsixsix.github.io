Today we are going to make a mail sender.

# Build
## Gophish
This sender based on [gophish](https://github.com/gophish/gophish).
So we just download it from the release page, and the unzip it
```
mkdir app
unzip gophish.zip -d app
cd app
```
modify the config.json file, change the admin_server's listen url into `0.0.0.0` if you want it to be exposed on the Internet
```
     "admin_server": {
         "listen_url": "127.0.0.1:3333",
         "use_tls": true,
         "cert_path": "gophish_admin.crt",
         "key_path": "gophish_admin.key"
     },
     "phish_server": {

```
Then we just start it.
```
sudo ./gophish
```
Now you can access the admin page on `https://127.0.0.1:3333/login?next=%2F`

**THE LOGIN USERNAME AND PASSWORD IS IN THE LOG** 
```

time="2021-02-06T06:20:57-05:00" level=info msg="Starting IMAP monitor manager"

```
Then you will enter into the dashboard.
## mailutils
First, you need to turn your vps into a mail server. If your operating system is ubuntu, you just need to do 
```bash
sudo apt-get install mailutils
```
setting the server to domain.

Then you can just send an email with sendmial
```
echo "test email" | sendmail xxxxx@protonmail.com
```
And of course, this email will be placed at the **SPAM** folder.

check the logs if you can not send the mail
- /var/log/mail.log
- /etc/postfix/main.cf
- /var/spool/mail (/var/mail/)

# Run
Then we just use the gophish to send an email .
## Sending Profiles
Setup the sending profiles to make it right.

You don't need to set the username and password, since your mailserver is at local.

You will receive a test mail.

## Templates
Firstly, you should export an email from your normal mailbox, make it an eml file.
Then click the `Import Email` button.

BUT one thing to remember,
the email will be sent into the SPAM folder. If you want to bypass this, we need to use `smtp2go`.
We will try it tmr, XD.
